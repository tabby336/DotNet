1. Using the project above please identify:
a. The number of Master page(s)
b. The structure of an aspx file
c. The structure of ascx file
d. Run the application (pressing F5) and identify the menu options
2. Create a new aspx page called: Compute
a. Add 2 textboxes, one button and one label (give them significant names->txtNumber1, btnCompute)
b. Write the necessary code to add 2 numbers that would be written into textboxes and show the result into the label
c. Add validations for textboxes (should allow only numbers)
d. Add another textbox and write the necessary code to add these 3 numbers. Show the result into the same label
e. Remove all the redundancies from code
3. Create a new aspx page called: FizzBuzz
a. Add a textbox, a button and a label
b. Add validations for textbox to allow numbers in the following interval: [5:100]
c. Solve the FizzBuzz problem (the number should be written down into text box)
"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to [number from textbox]. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."
The final result should look like: 12Fizz4Buzz…
d. Add a unit test project to this solution and write unit tests to have 100% code coverage for the previous problem.
4. Add the new pages into the current menu.
